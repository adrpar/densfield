* Problem:      Dealing with NaNs (0./0.)
  Description:  If the field on which the particles are mapped is much
                finer than the particle resolution, it can happen that
                some cells do not receive any value.  In that case, the
                velocity field in that cell becomes undefined and will
                currently lead to 0./0., i.e. NaN being written as the
                velocity of that cell.
  Todo:         a) Catch that situation in grid_divideVariablesByNum()
                b) Write a user-defined value for undefined cells
