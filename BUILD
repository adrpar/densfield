These are the build instruction for densfield.


Basic build
===========

Use the provides ./configure script to generate Makefile.config and
config.h.  You may also create them by hand, use the according .in as an
example.

  Then `make' will build the program and leave you with the executables
in src/.


Advanced option

All advanced code options are exported through the configure script.
Please run ./configure --help to get a list and descriptions of the
various options.

==================

You may also build the internal code documenation by running `make doc'.
This will utilize doxygen to prepare a html documenation in doc/ref/html
and also generate latex files in doc/ref/latex which can be compiled to
generate a PDF of the documentation.  Note that this is most like not of
use for the normal user.
